# 🔐 Azure Storage Access Lab

This lab demonstrates how to securely configure and manage access to Azure Storage resources using both identity-based and key-based access methods. The goal of this project is to showcase hands-on skills related to storage security, access control, and connectivity strategies in Azure.

## 💡 What This Lab Covers

1. **Understanding Storage Account**
   - Concepts of Azure storage accounts, types, and performance tiers.

2. **Create and Configure Storage Accounts**
   - Set up general-purpose v2 storage accounts via the Azure Portal or PowerShell.

3. **Configure Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks**
   - Restrict access by IP and VNets for secure connectivity.

4. **Create and Use Shared Access Signatures (SAS)**
   - Generate SAS tokens to allow scoped, time-bound access to specific resources.

5. **Configure Stored Access Policies**
   - Apply stored access policies for better SAS token governance.

6. **Manage Access Keys**
   - Rotate and monitor the two primary storage account keys.

7. **Configure Identity-Based Access for Azure Files**
   - Use Azure AD-based access control (RBAC) for secure file sharing.
